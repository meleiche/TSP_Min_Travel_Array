The aim of this file is to document the structure of folders and files containing data about the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) sample problems.
There're six problems for Symmetric graphs, and four problems for asymmetric graphs. Each folder has the same name of the graph. It contains four files as follows:


NAME = the name of the graph in TSPLIB

1) NAME.tsp for symmetric graph

NAME.astp for asymmetric graph

2) NAME_Data.txt
This file is the input to the program TSP_02.exe to compute the Minimum-Travel-Array for the graph.

3) Name_Solution.txt
This file is the output from the program TSP_02.exe.

4) NAME_Min_Array.csv
This file include the Minimum-Travel-Array in CSV format
